CLucene:

Install clucene as explained here http://clucene.sourceforge.net/

  once you do cmake and make, you no longer need the code in that repo. ensure that clucene headers are in /usr/local/include and libclucene-core and libclucene-shared libs are in /usr/local/lib.

*****

CLucene Driver:

1. cd clucene_driver/src
2. make clean ; make

*****

Why?

releasing this code because CLucene is released as "LGPL or Apache" and we are requested to contribute out feature additions back to the community.

Still Why?

1. CLucene development team provides a demo program to index and search files. CLucene heavily uses CMake and CMake litters a lot.
2. There is another single file demo program provided by the lead authors which inserts a bunch of characters and performs searches on them.

I want to contribute a single class which anyone can include in their code and start populating their own data. I myself read a mongodb collection and index it.

What?

/shared - its the same /shared folder in the CLucene repo. this driver program only marginally uses these files.
/src - clucene_driver.cc, clucene_driver.h and a test program t_clucene_driver.
/data - you may want to give this folder as the index location when you run t_clucene_driver.
